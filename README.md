# 🧘 StretchApp

> Combat sedentary fatigue with a full-stack break-management system designed for developers and long-term computer users.

## 🎯 Overview

StretchApp is a health and wellness tool built to address the physical strain of long hours at a desk. The application provides a structured "top-of-the-hour" timer that prompts users to take 5-minute movement breaks. By allowing users to target specific body areas, it delivers curated, visual exercise instructions to ensure physical well-being remains a priority during intense work sessions.

### Key Features

- **⏱️ Top-of-Hour Timer**: Intelligent 5-minute countdowns triggered at the start of every hour.
- **🎯 Targeted Recovery**: Select specific muscle groups (Neck, Back, Wrists, etc.) for personalized relief.
- **🎬 Visual Guidance**: Interactive GIF-based exercise library for clear, easy-to-follow instructions.
- **🔄 Dynamic Logic**: Randomized exercise selection to prevent routine fatigue.
- **🎨 Responsive UI**: A clean, intuitive interface built with SCSS and modular styling.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Logic & Routing (JavaScript)
- **Vanilla JS Engine**: Handles real-time countdown synchronization and UI state management.
- **Modular Data Structures**: Curated arrays of exercise assets categorized by body part.
- **EJS Templating**: Dynamic rendering of exercise components and timer states.

### Design & Styling
- **SCSS/CSS3**: Utilizes pre-processors for maintainable, nested styling and modular design.
- **Asset Management**: Integrated GIF library for instructional playback.
